# Intro

![](../static/img/logo.svg)

**Ashe is a data anonymisation solution for relational databases in healthcare.** It is designed to protect patient privacy by effectively anonymizing patient information while preserving the integrity and meaning of the data. Ashe is built using React and Node, and integrates with the current Data Foundation systems to ensure ease of use and a seamless user experience.

## Abstract
Healthcare organizations increasingly rely on electronic health records (EHR) to manage patient information. As a result, protecting patient privacy has become a critical issue, and data anonymisation is essential to ensuring patient confidentiality. This project aims to develop a data anonymisation solution for relational databases in healthcare. The proposed solution will address the variety of data types present in healthcare, including both categorical and real-valued data, to effectively anonymize information while preserving the integrity and meaning of the data.

## Scope
The project scope encompasses the following key objectives:
- Conduct a comprehensive review of existing data anonymisation methods and select the most appropriate techniques for relational databases in healthcare.
- Develop a software solution that implements the selected anonymisation techniques.
- Evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the solution through testing and validation using real-world healthcare data sets.
- Provide detailed technical documentation of the solution, including design, implementation, testing, and validation results.

## Methodology
We will take the following steps to complete the project:
1. Review of existing data anonymisation techniques and selection of the most appropriate methods.
2. Design and implementation of the software solution using React and Node.
3. Testing and validation of the solution using real-world healthcare data sets.
4. Documentation of the solution and the evaluation results.

## Timeline
The project timeline is estimated to be 2-3 months, with the following milestones:
1. Review of existing data anonymisation techniques: 2 weeks
2. Design and implementation of the solution: 7 weeks
3. Testing and validation: 2 weeks
4. Documentation and report writing: 1 week

## Scalability and Integration
The proposed solution will be scalable to accommodate future growth and demand, ensuring that it can handle larger data sets and support increased usage by healthcare organizations. It will also be designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Data Foundation systems to ensure ease of use and a seamless user experience.

## Impact
The implementation of this project will significantly impact the healthcare industry by providing a solution for protecting patient privacy through the effective anonymisation of relational databases. This solution will help healthcare organizations meet privacy regulations and ensure the confidentiality of sensitive patient information.
Requirements
The following requirements have been identified for the data anonymisation solution for relational databases in healthcare:
