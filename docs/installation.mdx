# Installation

## Frontend

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can check if they are already installed by running the following commands in your terminal:
   `node -v`
   We used `v19.8.1` for this project.
   `npm -v`
   We used `8.3.0` for this project.
   If any of these commands fail, you can install Node.js and npm from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   `git clone https://github.com/VanSHOE/IIIT_H_Anonymization`

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd IIIT_H_Anonymization/frontend`

4. Install the required dependencies:
   `npm install`

5. Run the project:
   `npm start`
6. The project should now be running on `localhost:3000`.
